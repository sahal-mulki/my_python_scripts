# Run the code

To download the code first click
![CODE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lepythoner/my_python_scripts/master/photos/Screenshot_2020-07-25%20lepythoner%20my_python_scripts.png)

Then press 
![ZIP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lepythoner/my_python_scripts/master/photos/Screenshot_2020-07-25%20lepythoner%20my_python_scripts(1).png)

The next step is to "Unpack" the zip Folder, to do that right-click the Zip folder which you downloaded
then press Extract All, and it will ask you where to extract to, just press OK. Then go into the new folder.

And then you can edit the code!

And if you get a error like this:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#1>", line 1, in <module>
    import tensorflow
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
```
Install the required library in this case "Tensorflow"

2. Networker.py - Network utility for administrators.
3. atomic_time.py - Gets you the exact time, calculated by an atomic clock.
4. cryptograhy.py - Can securely encrypt text using military-grade encryption.
5. Deleted now
6. wiki.py - Can fetch you information directly from wikipedia, just by typing in what you want.
